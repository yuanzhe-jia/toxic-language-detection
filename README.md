# Toxic Language Detection

Code for [In-Game Toxic Language Detection: Shared Task and Attention Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05995v4), accepted by AAAI 2023.

In-game toxic language becomes the hot potato in the gaming industry and community. There have been several online game toxicity analysis frameworks and models proposed. However, it is still challenging to detect toxicity due to the nature of in-game chat, which has extremely short length. Our work describes how the in-game toxic language shared task has been established using the real-world in-game chat data. In addition, we propose and introduce the model/framework for toxic language token tagging (slot filling) from the in-game chat.

## Model

**BRAR (Bi-directional Representations with Attention Residuals)** integrates:
- Bi-LSTM for feature extraction
- Attention residuals for global information
- Label forcing for prediction enhancement
- CRF for sequence labeling

## Dataset

Using the CONDA dataset with 6 slot labels:
- **T**: Toxicity
- **C**: Character
- **D**: Dota-specific
- **S**: Game Slang
- **P**: Pronoun
- **O**: Other

## Usage

```bash
python src/brar.py
```
